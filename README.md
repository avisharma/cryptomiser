*Encryption Library in C Language with optimised RSA*
***
### Background
The project serves as the minor project for a group of students pursuing B.Tech Computer Science with specialization in Cyber Security and IT forensics at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India.

### Objective
To create an easy to use library in C language that uses popular encryption algorithms such as RSA while simultaneously optimising the algorithms for least complexity using ancient mathematical techniques.
